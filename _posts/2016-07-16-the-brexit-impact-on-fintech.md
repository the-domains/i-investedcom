  In terms of Brexit news in general, personally I was shocked of the results. I
  did not expect the majority of the UK to vote "Leave". We are living in a
  globalised society where social connectivity does not recognise any borders
  and is fair to say that "business" is operating in this space too, with UK and
  EU at the centre of the global trade.
